This guide will help you to verify that your Kubernetes worker nodes have the required prerequisites to install OpenEBS and use OpenEBS Volumes to run your Kubernetes Stateful Workloads. In addition, you will learn about how to customize the installer according to your managed Kubernetes provider.

## Local PV Hostpath

### Minimum Supported Versions

- Kubernetes 1.12 or higher is required
- OpenEBS 1.0 or higher is required. 

### Prerequisites

Setup the directory on the nodes where Local PV Hostpaths will be created. This directory will be referred to as `BasePath`. The default location is `/var/openebs/local`.  

`BasePath` can be any of the following:
- A directory on root disk (or `os disk`). (Example: `/var/openebs/local`). 
- In the case of bare-metal Kubernetes nodes, a mounted directory using the additional drive or SSD. (Example: An SSD available at `/dev/sdb`, can be formatted with Ext4 and mounted as `/mnt/openebs-local`) 
- In the case of cloud or virtual instances, a mounted directory created from attaching an external cloud volume or virtual disk. (Example, in GKE, a Local SSD can be used which will be available at `/mnt/disk/ssd1`.)

:::note air-gapped environment
If you are running your Kubernetes cluster in an air-gapped environment, make sure the following container images are available in your local repository.
- openebs/localpv-provisioner
- openebs/linux-utils
:::

:::note Rancher RKE cluster
If you are using the Rancher RKE cluster, you must configure kubelet service with `extra_binds` for `BasePath`. If your `BasePath` is the default directory `/var/openebs/local`, then extra_binds section should have the following details:
```
services:
  kubelet:
    extra_binds:
      - /var/openebs/local:/var/openebs/local
```

## LVM Local PV

### Minimum Supported Versions

- K8S: 1.20+
- OS: Ubuntu
- LVM Version: LVM 2

### Prerequisites

Before installing LVM driver, make sure your Kubernetes Cluster must meet the following prerequisites:

1. All the nodes must have lvm2 utils installed and the dm-snapshot kernel module loaded.
2. Volume group has been setup for provisioning the volume.
3. You have access to install RBAC components into kube-system namespace. The OpenEBS LVM driver components are installed in kube-system namespace to allow them to be flagged as system critical components.

## ZFS Local PV

### Minimum Supported Versions

- K8S: 1.20+
- OS: Ubuntu and CentOS
- ZFS Version: ZFS 0.7 and ZFS 0.8

### Prerequisites

Before installing ZFS driver, make sure your Kubernetes Cluster must meet the following prerequisites:

1. All the nodes must have zfs utils installed.
2. ZPOOL has been setup for provisioning the volume.
3. You have access to install RBAC components into kube-system namespace. The OpenEBS ZFS driver components are installed in kube-system namespace to allow them to be flagged as system critical components.
